## Dominance
* One heuristic gives value greater than or equal to other heuristic
* Realistic estimates
* If we have 2 heuristics that do decently in different situations, can combine them 
## Weighted A* 
* Speed up search at the expense of optimality
* Take admissable heuristic, "Inflate" by multiple of alpha > 1 then perform A* search as usual 
* Fewer nodes tend to get expanded but the resulting solution may be suboptimal
* Note: Dr. Schwartz prefers optimality 
  * She does not like weighted A* 

## Missionary and Cannibal Problem Revisit
* 3 M's, 3 C's, and a boat 
* Possible Heuristics (Needs to be admissable)
  * Number of people on the left-1 to stay admissable, don't wanna overestimate
  * Relaxing constraints- number of people/2 since 2 can fit in boat at once
  * First heuristic will dominate second one though
