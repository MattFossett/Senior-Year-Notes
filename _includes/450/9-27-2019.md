## Why Study games?

## Games vs Single-Agent search
* We don't know how the opponent will act
* Efficiency is critical to playing well
  * Chess has a branching factor of 35
  * Search tree of 10^(154)

### Board example for a More abstract game tree found in slides
* Minimax is optimal if the opponent is optimal
* We can make minimax more efficient with Alpha-beta pruning
  * Its possible to compute the value for every node without expanding every node
  * 
## Alpha-Beta Pruning
* Aplpa is the best choice for the MAX player found so far
* Beta is the lowest utility choice found so far

if v>Beta at max
  prune;
if v < Alpha at min
  prune

## TODO: Understand Alpha Beta pruning
