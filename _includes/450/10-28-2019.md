## Probability
* P(A | B) said Probability of A given B
  * P(A | B) = (P(A, B)) / P(B) : said the probability of A and B divided by P(B)
  * P(A, B) is same as P(A and B)
* Chain rule- means we need lots of complicated conditional probabilities, which are hard to accurately get
* Independent- Two events are independent iff P(A and B) = P(A)P(B)
  * Allows us to break apart chain rule

## Bayesian Inference
* Product rule gives 2 ways to factor a joint probability
* P(A | B) = (P(B | A) P(A)) / P(B)
* Bayes Rule Example Written out
  * (P(Predict rain | Rain)P(0.14))  / P(Predict Rain)
  * Does he predict rain?
