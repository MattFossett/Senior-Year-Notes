## A* and Tree Searches
* Tree Search- May revisit states on a different path
* Graph Search- Don't allow revisiting states
  * Admissible Heuristic is **not** enough 
  * Need consistent Heuristic- F value should always be the same or lower since we're always getting closer to the goal
  * F value- f(n) = heuristic + actual or h(n) + g(n)
* A* is optimally efficient- no other ree based algorithm that uses the same heuristic can expand fewer nodes and still be optimal 
  * Exponential time and Space :(
  * Iterative deepening can apply to A* as well! 
    * Set depth limits and we are now limiting memory expanded at any level
    * Memory-Bounded A*- Only giving this much memory, after this is hit just throw away the worst looking paths. Typically works well but is slightly risky
* Also a recursive BFS

## Heuristics are key to everything
* Given a problem how do we get a decent heuristic
* Want to relax constraints of real world problem to come up with estimate of cost
* 8 Puzzle- only can slide tiles where empty space is- but for estimation what if we discard the idea of empty block
  * h1(n) how many things are in the wrong spots? Heuristic in example is 8 
  * Lets relax a bit less and limit to only up down left right movement
  * h2(n) only move U D L R
  * Manhattan distance- can only go U D L R distance
  * Admissable because they always underestimate
  * Better estimate would be the one yielding higher numbers, H2
* Dominance- if both heuristics are admissable, choose the one with greater than or equal to moves to yield more accurate results

## Missionaries and Cannibals
* 3 Canniblas and 3 missionaries, only 2 spots on boat
* No point to we want cannibals to outnumber missionaries or else that will be eaten
* They are crossing a river
* Lets find a heuristic
  * What does my state look like? 
  * What does my Successor Function look like?
  * Draw a search tree to make sure it is working
  * Talk about Admissable heuristics
  * Goal looks like (0, 0, F)
  * States look like (#C, #M, B)

* if b==true then -2 from either C, M, or one of each
* if b==false then +2C, -2M, +1C+1M, +1m, +1C
