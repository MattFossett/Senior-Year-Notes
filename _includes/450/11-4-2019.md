## Decision Trees
* Ask question and narrow in, where the history in the tree has information about the previous questions asked
* Classification technique
* For nominal target values (discreet)
* Decision trees are very descriptive
* Transparent, explains to the user how decisions are made
* Unfortunately, exponentially many trees can be constructed
* Formal description
  * Root node that has no incoming edges and zero or more outgoing edges
  * Internal nodes, has one incoming and and 2 or more outgoing
  * ...
* Building a tree is called decision tree induction
* Greedy strategy- sit and make best decision from this point. Do not reverse
* Hunt's algorithm
* Technically, information gain is only talking about entropy as a measure
* Gini index is a simpler formula, can possibly get different results
*
