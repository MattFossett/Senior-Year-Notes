|         | human             | ideal (Logical) |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------- | 
| **thought** | cognitive science, cognitive models |   proofs              |
| **action**  | turing test (mental health services)      | rational agents (cars) |

Most of the things we deal with fall in the Action realm. 
What do we need in a given system and why? Do militairy robots need to be stricly logical or follow a human element? 
Do tutors need humanlike behavior or strictly logical? Probably want an 
engaging humanlike figure. 

## Turing Test
When interacting with computer, that system will pass the turing test 
if you can not tell if it is human or computer. How does it hold up 
against ethical questions? Humor? Reasoning?
