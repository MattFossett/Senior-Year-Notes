## Planning (Not on midterm)
* Emphasis on the set of actions instead of the solution
* Constraint Satisfaction gives the solution, this gives the actions

### STRIPS
* Preconditions, additions, deletions
* Classic planning framework
* Conjunction of predicates
* To buy from store- 
  * Precondition: At(store) ^ Sells(store, x)
  * Effect: Have(x)
* How do we form a heuristic? 
  * Buy results in a Has
  * Our needs use the Has predicate
  * To satisfy Has then we need to Buy
