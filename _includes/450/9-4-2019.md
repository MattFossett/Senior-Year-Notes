## Lisp 
```lisp
; This is the consistent way to check for equality
(equal x y)
; Check if int
(integerp 3)
; check if dumber
(numberp 3.5)

; Lisp- When I see a paren I evaluate it by calling it as a function
;   To change this behavior, add backtick `

; Lets write a function sumlist
(sumlist `(1 3 4 6)) ; would evaluate to 14

; Want to take off first element and add it to the result of sumlist (smaller list)
; car and cdr- name goes back to how they're stored
; car- contents of address register
; cdr- contents of decrement register (contents of everything past first element)
; Benefit- you can use caadr and caaa..aar to indicate use more of it
; Can even mix 

(defun sumlist (x) 
    (cond
        ((null x)  0) ; Check if list is empty
        (T ; not nil, always evaluates
            (+ (car x) (sumlist (cdr x)))    
        )
    )
)

(inclist `(2 5 4)) ; should return `(3 6 5)
; How do we build up a list? 
; cons- takes an elment `a and adds to list
(cons `a `(b c)) -> `(a b c)
(cons `(a b ) `(c d)) -> ((a b) c d)
; Second argument NEEDS to be a list, it will do the dot when printing
; append- takes 2 list arguments and merges to 1 list
; list- function that takes one element and makes it a list
; Back to inclist
; Base case is empty list
(defun inclist (x)
    (cond
        ((null x) `()) ;can also return nil since it is the same as empty list
        (T (cons (+ 1 (car x)) (inclist (cdr x))))
    )
)

; lambda functions- defining functions on the fly
(function (lambda (x) (* x x)))
; this is useless here because it is thrown away, uncallable. 
; CAN do this inline in a call to something else, does not need a name

#`(lambda (x) (* x x)) ;shorthand to do the same thing

(funcall #`(lambda (x) (* x x ) ) 3) ;This will now apply 3 as the param of function

(defun greater (f x y) 
    (if (> (funcall f x) (funcall f y)) x y)
) 
; we can now provide a function as a parameter

```

### Rules
* Can't use loops
* Cant use setq
* can use let
* f functions are destructive functions that break functional programming
* Values as parameters need to be passed by value, immutable 
* (mapcar `absval `(2 -3 4) ) -> `(2 3 4)
