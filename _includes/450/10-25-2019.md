## Making decisions under Uncertainty
* Action A = leave for airport t minutes before flight
* Problems:
  * Partial observability (traffic, etc)
  * Noisy sensors 
  * Flat tire
  * Complexity of modeling and predicting traffic
* As t increases the probability of catching flight increases
* We need a Utility to maximize that says I want to catch my flight but not wait forever
* Frequentism- Probabilities are relative frequencies
* Subjectivism- Degrees of believe
* Probability problems denote variabiles with capital letters
  * R: is it raining
  * W: whats the weather?
  * These statements are defined as events
* Atomic event- complete specification of the state of the world, or a complete assignment of domain values to all random variables
* Joint probability distributions
  * n vars
  * d values
  * How many atomic events? d^n
  * Horrible space usage, exponential
  * instead of simply P(condition==true) it's P(condition1, condition2)
