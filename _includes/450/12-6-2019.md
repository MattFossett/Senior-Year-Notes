## Robots
* Agriculture, assembly lines, all helpful domains for robots
* 3 D's: dirty, dull, dangerous
* 3 primitives- sense, plan, act
    * Called the heirarchical approach
    * A very computer science way to approach a problem 
1. Modularity
2. Niche targetability
3. Ease of portability 
4. Robustness

* Reactive paradigm works well in robotics
* Sense <---> Act: Tightly interwoven, no planning
* Level 1: existance proof
    EX: wright brothers used birds to figure out flight
    EX: Look to biology for something that works, like mosquito uses heat to find humans
* Level 2: Decomposition of problem
    * Inputs, outputs, actions
    * How does the mosquito operate
* Level 3: How to implement process
    * How does a mosquito do it and can we mimick it? 

* Agent- self contained, independent (no human), own brains, can interact with world make changes and sense whats happening- autonomous
* Originally and even today we have teleoperation- person remotely controls the robot
* We want autonomous agents though

* Behaviors:
    * Reflexive- hardwired, stimulus response
    * Reactive- learned then consolidated so conscious thought not needed
    * Conscious
