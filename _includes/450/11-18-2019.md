Use a function in z3 to be a mapping from person to commity member, and constrain possible solutions on a function

f(x) != f(y)

## Neural Networks
* Perceptron- if weighted sum of inputs greater than a value, fire particular neuron to next set of neurons
  * Only capable of linear function
  * Capable of something like an AND or an OR, since they are linearly separable 
* Multilayer neural net- more complexity out of functions
  * Each layer is a processing step
  * More complex functions
  *
