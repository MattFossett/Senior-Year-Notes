## Back on the design pattern grind
* Command
    * Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue, or log requests and support undoable operations
    * Promote "Invocation of a method on an object" to full objects

## Tasks
* For every test, use a formal testing framework that is appropriate for our language
* Ensure that nothing can be merged to dev without all tests running in cloud (continuous integration)
    * travisCI, circleCI, AzurePiplines
* Test as close to all code as possible
* Artifact improvement- Actually comment on tasks in GH for how much time was spent, PM should be able to look at project Kanban and get birds eye view on everything

* Need a Graphical User Environment
* Need attributes
    * create edit and delete them
* Create edit and delete relationships
    * Deleting class removes all relationships


[ animal , dog , cat ]

dog {

dog {
    parent: UMLItem animal;
}

Thoughts on Technical Side of Features
* Attributes
    * comma separated attribute entries so that we don't have to pick a class every time
    * 
* Relationships
    * Multiple parents
    *
