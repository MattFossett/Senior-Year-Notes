## Overview Design Patterns
* Design pattern general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design
* Is not a finished design that can be transformed into code
* Is a description or template for how to solve a problem

### Criticisms
* Targets the wrong problem 
* Lacks formal foundations 
* Leads to inefficiency 
* Does not differ from other abstractions
* Only applicable to OOP

### Categories of Design Patterns
* Creational design patterns
  * All about class instantiation
  * Composed of class creation (inheritance) and object creation (delegation)
* Structural Design
  * Implementation structure
  * Class and Object composition
  * inheritance
* Behavioral Design
  * All about class object communication

### 6 Creational Patterns
* Abstract Factory
  * Creates an instance of several families of classes
* Builder
  * Separates object construction from its representation
* Factory method
  * Creates an instance of several derived classes
* Object Pool
  * Avoid expensive acquisitions and release of resources by recycling objects no longer in use
* Prototype
  * Fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
* Singleton
  * Class of which only a single instance can exist

### 8 Structural Patterns
* Adapter
  * Match interfaces of different classes
* Bridge 
  * Separate an objects interface from implementation
* Composite
  * Tree structure of simple and composite objects
* Decorator
  * Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
  * Wrapper for other classes, like Drawable
* Flyweight
  * Fine-Grained instance used for efficient sharing
* Facade
  * Single class that represents and entire subsystem
* Private Class Data
  * Restricts accessor/mutator access
* Proxy
  * Object representing another object

### Behavioral Patterns
* Iterator
  * Abstract model that we use
  * C++ we have increment, compare and dereference
    * Called a forward iterator
* Mediator  
  * Defines simplified communication between classes
* Memento 
  * Capture and restore an objects internal state
* Chain of Responsibility
  * Way of passing request between chain of events
* Command 
  * Encapsulate request as an object
* Interpreter
  * Way to include language elements in a program
* Null object- acts as default value for an object
* Observer- Way of notifying change to a number of classes
  * If class is moved around with arrows then every arrow needs to know its end location has moved
* State- Alter an objects behavior when its state changes
* Strategy- Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
* Template method- Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
* Visitor- Defines new operation to a class without change
  * BST that needs to be printed- tree should not know how to print itself but we can write a visitor that goes in order and prints 

#### Abstract Factory
* Provides Interface for creating families of related or dependant objects without specifying their class
* A hierarchy that encapsulates: many possible "platforms" and the construction of a suite of "products"
* the **new** operator is considered harmful
#### Builder
* Intent- separate the construction of complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create 
* Acts as a dispatcher of things that need made
* Think StringBuilder, can append strings/ints/chars and at the end we'll get a toString
#### Factory Method
* Define an interface for creating an object
* Defining a virtual constructor
*
