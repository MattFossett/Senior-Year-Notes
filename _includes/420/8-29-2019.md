## Software Dev Processes
### Software Engineering layers
* Process: framework of the required tast
  * How do we solve problems?
* Methods: Technical "how to"
  * Implementing code, testing
* Tools: Automate processes and methods
  * How can we automate these things?

#### Traditional method: Waterfall Process
* Gather requirements: what are we trying to do?
* Specify how to adhere to the requirements
* Discuss how we want to design specification
* Implement that design 
* Integrate product
* **We test throughout the entire process**
* We can only propagate changes after every step is done
##### The Waterfall workflow:
1. Start with an "abstract thing", gradually figuring out what it should do
  * Raw list of wants/features
  * Create written artifact
  * Talk to customers when possible! 
    * They may not know exactly what they want 
  * We don't want to build the wrong thing! 
    * Don't wanna write down wrong thing
    * Can't have an incomplete software
  * Gather information
  * Mostly customer oriented 
2. Specification
  * Unify abstract entities 
  * **Written description of what the system does**
    * Needs to encompass all circumstances and all inputs in **every** possible state
    * Need to brainstorm different scenarios
      * User clicks then action happens. Then when they click again a sub-action happens. 
  * Written document, another artifact
  * Each sprint will result in new expected behavior in the specification
  * Comprehensive, not just list of requirements, rather a high level of how we should be concerned
3. Design
  * System architecture
  * Decompose system into **modules** that **should** be as independent as possible from one to another
    * Does not necessarily happen much in reality do to things like scaling 
    * Perhaps a more reasonable idea is that subsets of these modules are completely independent
    * Specify interfaces between modules
    * Some modules will never need to communicate
      * EX: View knows about the model but not the other way around
  * Emphasis on **how** the system works rather than what it does
4. Implementation
  * Code up the design
  * Have code implemented
  * Need a plan- order that the tasks are performed in
    * Priority is a great way to order tasks
    * Testability- **never** write code we can't test. Need a measure of success! (Otherwise will never finish)
      * Need to be able to individually test each module
      * Module tests must be able to be isolated: don't **need** 2 modules implemented just to test them. 
5. Integration
  * Put the pieces together and watch it work
  * Quality Assurance people are now able to test all the integration between every single module and how they work together
    * Quality Assurance (QA) people are testing from the design spec
    * They do not test individual modules, they focus on interactions between them
  * What do we do when integration fails?
    * Trying to release a product
    * Fix it.
6. Product
   * Ship it
   * Things will break
   * Maintain it!

##### Waterfall Opinions
Waterfall model **was** standard Software Dev for over 20 years. 
* There is **no** iteration or feedback between stages
* Can't change your design!
  * Can't ship a broken product
  * Have to essentially start at square 1 every time
  * Clients can't request quick fixes, they have to wait 
  for the next cycle
* Risks
  * Relies heavily on accurate assessment of requirements
  * Little feedback from users until after shipped
  * Problems aren't found until super late
  * Working version isn't seen until integration 
  * Programmers aren't doing anything until design is ready, could be weeks of wasted time
* Model was adopted from the Engineering field
  * Great way to build a bridge
* Very little software is still built using this model
* There are good aspects
  * Continuous testing
  * Emphasis on spec/design/testing
  * Emphasis on communication
## Why is time important 
* The world changes
* Technologies quickly become obsolete
* Other people produce competitive software
* Short term world will not change but we need to constantly evolve
  * need to make near-term predictions
### Rapid Prototyping
* Write super quick prototype
* Show users and get immediate feedback 
* Then proceed to waterfall model
* Customer feels more cared about
* Hard to throw away that prototype
  * We should design it from scratch because it will be so much better
  * If we know it can be better than we need that well designed and maintainable code
* Prototype can expose design mistakes!
  * We then know to make those corrections
### Still not how it goes in reality
* Need feedback between stages
* Perhaps be able to dial things back, simplify things during the process
* Final product even could lead to changes in requirements
* Need waterfall model with **feedback loops**
* What do we do? 
  * Accept that later stages influence earlier stages
  * Need to plan for that and make sure its feasible
  * Every successful company minimizes risk and maximizes profits 
    * The scope of this course is to minimize risk
### Iterative Models: Plan for Change
* Use the same stages as the waterfall model
but plan to iterate the whole cycle several times
  * Typically 2 or 3 iterations per sprint
  * Every cycle is known as a build
  * Smaller and faster than entire product
  * After every loop we have a fully spec compliant code, fully tested
  * Don't do a lot in each iteration
    * Perhaps implement one feature and test the heck out of it 
    * Very interesting process to begin with
    * 2 people perhaps assigned to every task, any given time you're working on 2 tasks: feature that is individual and another task is integration that takes other features and makes sure that they integrate well. 
      * The team as a whole plans planning and requirements  
      * Analysis and design is only a couple people
      * Evaluation is only other couple people
      * Idea is to knockout one feature every single week
1. Gather Requirements
  * Same was as before, talk to users and find whats needed
  * Start of every spring we will be given requirements
  * Recognize diminishing returns: If something will take forever then hold off for a while, then the team as a whole can tackle it 
  * Always **need** something to show the customer
    * Need to have an idea of where to evolve
2. Spec
  * Same as before
3. Design
  * Decompose into modules
  * What could change? Interfaces are a great idea since we don't care ab implementation detail just API
  * Plan incremental development in each module 
  * from skeletal component to full functionality
  * Most to least critical features
  * During Build 1: 
    * All skeletal pieces are there but they don't do much
    * UI is not done in build 1
    * Recommendation: whenever something needs displayed then just console log, don't need buttons immediately
4. Implementation
  * Always have demo after build 1
  * Communication
  * Each build adds more functionality 
5. Integration
  * integration and major test for each build
  * Ready to verify all integration
  * QA ensures everything works as expected
Advantages:
  * Find problems sooner
  * See progress
  * More quantifiable!
Disadvantages:
  * More complicated
  * Major mistake in requirements/spec/design is disaster
  * We code before problem is fully understood
    * Trade off for risk of being slow
In practice:
  * Most consumer software dev uses the iterative model
    * Daily builds
    * System always working
  * People in our field are the ones using iterative, while business people may not be as inclined
#### Summary
* Iterative is the way to go
* Extreme programming, agile process, next 

### Extreme Programming (XP)
* Version of the iterative model
* Goals
  * Minimize unnecessary work
  * Maximize communication and feedback
  * Make sure devs do most important work
  * Make system flexible, ready to meet any change in requirements
#### History
* 1999: from Kent Beck 
* Speed to market, rapidly changing requirements
#### XP Practices
* On site customer
* Planning game
* small releases
* Testing
* Simple design
* Refactoring
* Metaphor
* Pair programming
* Collective ownership
* Continuous integration- We will have Github unit test our code on a pull request, and it will not merge unless passed
* 40 hour weeks (Not applying to us, ours is more like 10)
* Coding standards- We all define formatting guidelines and naming conventions
  * Look into a **linter** which will not let us merge unless code is up to defined standard
#### XP Process: Multiple Short cyles (2 weeks)
1. Meet with client to elicit requirements
2. Planning game
  * Take what user wants and break up into individual tasks
  * Estimate time cost
3. Implementation
  * Write programmer tests first
  * Simplest possible design to pass the tests
  * Code in pairs (Preferred because then 2 people understand their given section of code)
  * Occasional refactor the code 
4. Evaluate progress and reiterate from step 1
* Its like iterative but pushed to the extreme
#### XP Customer
* expert customer is part of the team
  * On site, always available
  * Communication and feedback
  * Make sure we build what the client wants
* Customer involved active in all stages
  * Clarifies requirements
  * Negotiates with the team what to do next
  * Writes and runs acceptance tests
  * Constantly evaluates versions 
  * How often is this feasible?
    * Totally depends.
#### Planning game: Writing Stories
* Write on index cards
  * Meaningful title and short description of what customer wants (or what we think they want)
* Focus on What, not why or how
* Use client language- Client must be able to test if a story is completed 
* Don't need all stories in first iteration
##### Example:
* CEO needs accounting software for Accounting software. 
  * Need to be able to make account
  * Delete
  * Query balance
  * List accounts
* Currently don't care about how or why, just What
* Story 1 
  * Title: Create account
  * Description: I can create a named account
* Story 2
  * List accounts
  * Desc: I can get a list of accounts
  * "But how will that display?"
  * Modify description to answer that question
* We gradually stipulate additional requirements
* Customer needs to describe how the stories will be tested
  * This is a simple description of their expectations when using the software
  * "When I do this I expect this"
  * "When I do bad action I expect this error"
  * We need to be able to make tests based on their description
* Tasks- Developer centered Description
  * Every story is broken into tasks
  * Easy to split up work
  * Can't all work on same thing
  * Some stories may break down into many tasks while others possibly only 1
  * Only breakdown enough to estimate cost
  * Validate with customer
