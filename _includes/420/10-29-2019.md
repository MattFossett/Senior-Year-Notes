## REST API's, Microservices and Scalability

### REST
* Representational State Transfer
    * Used for ajax
* Not tied to web or HTTP or physical structure of the system
* Key abstraction- Resource, named by a URI
    * UTI: Address or resource
    * No URI means it is not a resource
    * URI is just the www.google.com/search?q=query+string kind of thing, URL parameters
* All interactions are context free: Send authentication every time
*
