## Be a Team Player
emphasis on team aspects

## UML
* Describing system at high level of abstraction
    * Model of the system
    * Used for requirements and Specification
* Many notations over time
    * State machines
    * Entity relationship diagrams
    * Dataflow diagrams- what info needs sent to do a task 
### History
* Rise of OOP
* New class of modeling 
* tons of new modeling languages (over 50,000)
* 3 leading OO notations decide to merge

* UML stands for **Unified Modeling Language**
* Design by committee
    * Many interest groups participating
    * Everyon contributes and resulting design is huge
    * Some call it **Union of all Modeling Languages**

### Explanation- use case
* Elements
    * Actors- click buttons
    * Use Cases- Certain actors can perform certain cases
    * Relations
    * EX: Students can submit to autolab, professors can grade 

| Waiter | Client | Cashier | Chef |
| ------ | ------ | ------- | ---- |
|serves food | eats food | transaction | cooks food|

### Project and resource management system
* Resource manager manages resources
* Project manager manges projects
* Sysadmin is responsible for administrative functions of the system
* Backup system houses backup data for the system

*48:00 of recording, see photo*

### Class Diagrams
* Describes classes (OO)
* Static
    * Displays what interactics but not what happens when they interact
* Each box is a class
    * List Fields
    * List methods
### Association, Aggregation, Composition
* There are different notations and shapes to express each
EX: One car-4 wheels; Project has 1 consultant

### Generalization
* Interactions between classes
* RequestButton- Specific type of button etc

### Goal
* Software that can model itself using UML

### Object Diagram
* Instantiation of class diagram (Now obsolete)

## Semantic Versioning
* How do we version our software?
    * Semantic Versioning: Version 4.1 
    * MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH are each important numbers
    * Major- 1.7.2 to 2.0.0 means incompatable API update, could potentially break software!!
    * Minor- Add funcitonality in a backwards compatible manner
    * Patch- Version when you make backwards compatable bug fixes
* Additional things could be specified for pre-release
* We start at 1.0

### Dependencies
* Dependency hell- Need specific version of piece of software. Gets worse as software grows
* Want things labeled correctly 
* Want several open source dependencies 
* Version Lock- Inability to update a package
* Version promiscuity means that versions are labeled too loosely
* For semantic versioning we need a public API- some functionality 
    * In a perfect world Killian takes our model and plugs in his own view and has his app work with our data. Seemless
* Write an internal API for model manipulation
    * Keep track of classes and info they contain
    * Abstract entity that we can manipulate
* API can be documented or code-enforced
* Increment the correct part of the version number when any public changes are made
* All strict specification is laid out in slides

## GIT Version Control
Distrubuted version control

### General Workflow
* Initial Commit-0______________________
    * branch: Feature/zoppetti/api-0-0-0^
    * branch: Feature/killian/controller-0-0-0-0-0-0
    * branch: Feature/schwartz/tests-0-0-0-0
* Notice: Feature branches for every person and their task
* Main line: called **develop branch**
* Once we wanna release we merge to master, where we tag our releases
* Can't merge into develop without passing tests!
* **Origin** is always Github
    * Each person communicates with Github
    * Its possible to communicate only with other computers instead of origin but we will not do that
    * Master is only used for production releases themselves
    * **Never** commit a feature directly to develop. Make a branch then later merge
* Emphasis on **Parallel Development**
* Hotfix branch is for bug fixes
    * Bug fixes are off master
