## Test Driven Development & Behavior Driven Dev
* Behavior- develop user stories to describe how app will work
    * User stories become acceptance tests and integration tests
* Test driven- Step definitions for a new story
    * Write unit and functional tests first
    * Write tests for the code you wish you had 
    * Made popular by extreme programming
    1. Add a test
        * Use cases are used to understand the requriements
    2. Run all tests and see the new one fail
        * Ensure test framework is working
    3. Write some code
        * Only code that is designed to pass the test
    * Instant feedback
    * Promotes and encourages better development practices
* Quality Assurance- having up to date tests that are reasonable for evaluating new feature
* TDD Limitations- Difficult in GUI, web services etc
    * Requires a mock object- provide false info controllable by testing framework 
        * Allows us to model a button click, etc

### Behavior Driven design
* Asks about behavior before and during development
* Requirements written as user stories
* BDD Concentrates on behavior of app vs. implementation of app
* Connextra
    * feature name
    * As a [kind of stateholder], So that [I can achieve goal], I want to [do task]
    * Require these 3 phases
    * User story is an acceptance test before code is written
