## Test Driven development, Bug Fixes
* Fail unit test
    * Repair code to pass the test
* Fail an acceptance test (user story)
    * Means not enough user tests
    * Add a user test, then fix the code to pass test
* **Always write code to fix tests**
    * Don't change tests unless they're actually wrong
### Simplicity
* KISS- keep it simple stupid
* Just in time design- design what you know right now, don't worry too much about future design decisions
* No premature optimization- you may not need it
    * Only optimize if user thinks it is slow
    * Write it well once
* In every big system there is a simple one waiting to get out
## Refactoring- Improving the design of code
* Make the code easier to read/use/modify
    * Change "how" code does something
* Effect should be the following- action(x) => y no matter what. We can have multiple versions of action though, action1, action2. Always getting y. 
* Refactoring only changes action, not input or output. **how**
    * Ex- if we need to sort and we pick bubble sort it may be too slow. We can change how we sort by refactoring, picking a better algorithm
### Removing duplicate code
* if we notice common code then extract it out, makes intent more clear
* Use more methods if we repeat code a lot, keep private when possible
* Introduce methods to shorten code
### Change names
* Renaming in our public API will mean new major version
* Renaming just internal API is just simple bug fix
* Why care about naming? Choosing how to name something is tough, since we want it to be so many things: short/meaningful etc
* moveRightIfCan, moveRight, canMoveRight? What is desired?
    * Client with 2D top down video game wants to move right when possible
    * moveRightIfCan sounds horrible
    * how about tryMoveRight, for possibilities it is nice to use "try"
        * should always return boolean value
```
try(check(property), mutator(property)){
    if (check(property)){
        property = mutator(property)
        return true
    }
    return false;
}
```
* How can we effectively rename? Use the tools that your environment gives you for renaming. **Make sure documentation reflects these changes.**
* When code is refactored make sure nothing broke- need suite of regression tests
    * **Only refactory working code**, don't refactor when implementing a feature
    * **Only commit working code**
    * **Every commit needs to be buildable on develop branch**
## Continuous Integration
* All tests run on **develop** branch so whenever we want to merge, the tests are all run. Code will not merge until test passes.
* This gives us a history of working/not working commit attempts
## Pair Programming
* 2 people use 1 computer, pilot/copilot 
* Pilot types, thinks local
* Copilot monitors high-level issues, "Have you thought of this" etc, thinks about how code will react with other modules
* Disagreements point to early design issues! Helpful
* Pairs shuffled periodically
### Benefits of Pair Programming
* Results in better code (Proven in industry)
* 2 people understand the code! Collectively understood
* As team reviews code there are 2 people capable of discussing implementation details
* Reduces risk
* Improves focus/productivity- forces both parties to be accountable
* Knowledge and Skill migration- Both people know more about each others better topic
* Good habits spread
### Peoples Pair Programming complaints
* "It will slow me down"
* People are afraid to show that they're not a genius
#### Why managers resist
* Inefficient use of 2 people on one piece of code
* Resistance from developers
## Evaluation and planning
* Run acceptance tests
* Assess what was completed
* Discuss the problems that come up
    * This sucked because x and it was solved by y
    * Person was sick, I couldn't figure out their code. I rewrote their documentation. 
* Compute the speed of the team
* Re-estimate remaining stories
* Plan with client for next iteration
## What's different about extreme programming
* No one has specific roles
    * We are all analysts, architects, programmers, testers and integrators
* No complete up-front analysis and design
    * Everyone makes decisions throughout development
* Develop infrastructure and frameworks as you develop your application
    * Not up-front
    * quickly deliver business value in the driver, need to show progress!
### When to use XP
* Dynamic project in small teams
* Projects with requirements prone to change
* Customer available
### When not to use XP
* Requirements are truly known and fixed
* Cost of late changes high
* Unavailable customer
### What can go wrong
* Requirements defined incrementally
    * Scope creep
* Design is on the fly
    * Can lead to significant redesign
    * No features should remove more than 10% after features are set originally
* Customer representative

## Agile Software Development
* Coined in 2001
* Process called **scrum**, very specific process that if not followed specifically followed is **not** scrum
    * Scrum refers to how a project is managed
* Build software incrementally, using short 1-4 week iterations
### Structure of Agile Team
* Cross functional team
    * Devs, testers, product owner, scrum master
* Product Owner
    * Define and prioritize requirements
    * Determine release date and content
    * Lead iteration and release planning meetings
* Scrum master
    * Leader, ensures full productivity
    * We don't need a scrum master since part of their responsibility is to enable cooperation across roles, and we don't have roles
    * Essentially the goto for everything **not** technically about code
### Iterations
* Team works in iterations to deliver user stories
* Set of unfinished user stories go in back-log
* Iteration time is fixed (ours is 3 weeks)
* Stories are planned by priorities/size/team capacity
* Each user story is given a size estimate given relative scale
### When is a story done?
* All tasks completed
* All acceptance tests running
* zero open defects
* Accepted by product owner
## Scrum
* Process Skeleton- Just a process
* Set of practices and pre-defined roles
    * ScrumMaster
    * Product owner
    * Team
### Sprint Planning
* Which user stories from the backlog go into a sprint
* Team determines how much they can then commit to complete
* During a sprint, the sprint backlog is frozen
    * Do not worry about other stuff
### Meetings: Daily Scrum
* Each day during the sprint a project meeting occurs
* Meeting
    * Starts on time
    * 15 minute hard deadline
    * Anyone is welcome
* Questions
    * What have you done
    * What will you do 
    * What is blocking you?
        * This is not solved or answered IN scrum, it is resolved outside of scrum
* Scrum of Scrums- We will not do, but a giant meeting with people from different teams attending and others can ask questions
    * Will you be releasing something big soon
    * What has changed
* Sprint related meetings
    * Sprint planning- what we will work on
    * Review- done with sprint and trying to close up
    * Retrospective- look back and measure things like velocity, blocking issues, etc
## Recommended Approach
* Agile+Classical
* Classical
    * Staged waterfall development
    * Generation of project documentation as you go
* Agile
    * XP Planning game to move from customer requirements to design 
    * Test driven development
    * Refactoring
    * Continuous integration
    * Pair Programming
## Come up with user stories
