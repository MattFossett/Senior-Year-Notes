## Kanban
* Not restricted to Software Dev
* Business Process
* Can't do more work than capable of doing, but we are only capable of x amount of work
* Kanban cards act as placeholders of things we can do 
* Example- Simulate a Process using Kanban
    1. Draft a proposal for a project
    2. Process- Once accepted you have room in deciding what works best
        * Can decide what works best based on studying different methods
        * Develop a set of directions to follow
    3. Actual Execution
* Why are we using Kanban?
    * Iterative development has challenges- how do we divide work up?
    * Forward thinking too much could mean we lose focus on work for right now
    * Quality suffers as deadlines are approaching and rushing happens
    * Kanban encourages continuous flow- by the time the next sprint starts we already have to know what to work on
* How do we setup Kanban?
    * Github has issues in the development category
    * These "boxes" should incrementally move towards development, and if they need reverted only revert one step back 

1. Determine acceptance criteria for a story (what makes it done)
2. Develop
3. Test
4. Deploy everything related to a story at the same time

* Do not revisit a user story
* Project managers can give an expedite track for prioritized task 
* Important thing about visible goals on board- promotes focus

* Feature to develop->Tasks in queue->in progress tasks->tasks complete->Once all complete then feature is complete

## GIT

* Git add, commit and push may be useful in personal projects but in a group setting not necessarily the case
* Add- Takes changes and adds them to staging area 
* Commit- Takes files from staging and commits (adds) to the repository
* Push- Takes your whole local repo and copies to remote repo
* Clone- Take remote repo and clone it into your local environment
* Tracked files- Belong to local repo
* Untracked files- .bin, temp files, useless things that we don't need
* Pull- aggregate of 2 commands- fetch followed by merge
* Fetch- Updates local repo with info from remote
* Merge- 
* Dirty working directory- keep files that we don't wanna get rid of yet (not important)
* **Only commit code that compiles**
* How to write a git commit message- brief description of changes, possibly add things like [hotfix] 
* git log --oneline
* git blame: see who wrote a line of code
* Daily scrum- this is what I've done, this is what I need to do, this is what is blocking me
