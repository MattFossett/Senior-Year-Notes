## Designer oriented goals
* Money
    * Not ideal, tough industry to get into and make money
* Community
    * Game creators supporting each others work 
    * Grouping of people with similar interests
* Personal Expression
    * Wanting to express an idea, game could be best medium
* The Greater Good
    * Teaching valuable skill
    * Changing players' minds
    * Diagnosing or treating players' illnesses 
* Practice
    * Best way to make a great game in the future is to make a bad game now

## Player centric Goals
* Fun
    * Enjoyable, engaging, fulfilling
    * Not every game needs to be fun though
* Lusory Attitude
    * Being happy about constraints of rules
    * Try to succeed in something with no real consequence, like me playing baseball
    * Respect players' commitment of time, money and intelligence and give them something valuable in return 
* Flow
    * When you are intensely focused on something, so focused that you don't notice anything around you and when its over you feel accomplished
    * Time passes without notice
    * Super engaging
* Structured Conflict
    * Way to test skills, demonstrate mastery, and work out aggression without any actual violence or danger
* Empowerment 
    * Allowing players to have experiences that would not be possible in the real world
    * Allowing players to set their own goals
    * Allowing players to express themselves creatively within your game
* Attention and Involvement
    * Concentrating on the screen
    * Thinking about the events in the game rather than distracting thoughts about real life
    * Mental engagement even when not playing the game
* Interesting Decisions
    * Discernable and Integrated
        * Integrated- my decision will impact the game
    * Ambiguous- Player cannot know exactly what outcome will be
    * Double-edged- options have positive and negative consequences
    * Novel- different from previously made decisions
    * Clear- player understands what they are choosing
* Experiential understanding- Letting players experience the world from another persons perspective

## 2D Graphics
* When selecting 2D or 3D project, all this does is setup defaults, not any other big difference

### Sprites
* Have an x,y,z position but only x,y really matters
* Sprite sheet- Many images packed side by side in a larger image
    * Only one part should be displayed at a time
    * Usually used for animations
    * Requires use of sprite editor to specify how to slice image up
    * Need to specify a sprite mode of multiple instead of single
        * Then need to explain how to div it up
        * Sprite editor>slice>auto may work, but specific is better
### Drawing order
* Sorting layers are all assigned to sprites, backgrounds should have higher priority in the list- drawn first

### 2D Physics
* Many different collider types, plus a rigid body
* Make sure that you get them from the 2D physics menu

### Tilemaps
* Put lots of sprites on screen in a grid
