## Rigid Body Component
* Makes object use the physics engine
* Has many properties
* Physics Component- Is Kinematic- Property to make it respond to others
* Apply kinematic rigid body to cube that is moving
    * Then apply rigid body to the other cube- NOT kinematic for this one

## Colliders
* ALlow us to detect this object touching another object as long as both have a collider
* Sphere capsule box and mesh are listed from fastest to slowest as far as computation
    * Mesh collider would be tailored to the shape of the object itself, but is very cpu heavy
* At least one object colliding with another needs a rigid body for them to interact, both need colliders
* If I want something to move, it should be Is Kinematic, else it should not
* Trigger is for when you don't want the collision

## Physics Materials
* Control friction and bounciness of objects

## Collider interaction matrix
* Slide that explains what will happen when objects collide 

## Raycasting
* Send a ray out from a location in a direction and see what the ray hits first
* Can only hit things with colliders
* bool Physics.Raycast(Vector3 origin, Vector3 direciton, out RaycastHit, float distance)
    * The out parameter means that we can return 2 things at same time, so this returns a boolean and will also fill the out param with info 
* RayCastHit has collider property
* Often the origin of the ray will be the player
