## What makes games different than other entertainment?
* Mechanics- rules of interacting between player and game
* Aesthetics- how our senses percieve the game 
* Technology- how it actually functions
* Narrative- the story of the game

### These things are broken into 3 layers
* Inscribed layer- MATN that we have most control over
    * We build into the software
* Dynamic layer- MATN that is being played, player essentially builds this as they play
    * We have to forecast what the players experience will be in this layer
* Cultural layer- people get together in groups about this game and form their own games 

#### We focus primarily on the Inscribed layer
* Not every game has every element

## Mechanics
* Objectives- things we want the player to accomplish
    * Not every game necessarily has these but most do
    * Multiple objectives with different layers of immediecy
    * Short term goals are good for quick easy accomplishment
    * Long term is the long fight, get good then approach it
    * Objectives range from point totals, beating levels, beating the whole game, unlocking gates in a level, etc
    * There are typically primary (required) objectives and secondary objectives
    * Do we want objectivs that conflict with each other? Choose one objective or the other? 
        * This builds decisions and can feel more immersive 
        * also can be frustrating if it means some goals are then incompletable
* Relationships between players
    * Single player attempts to achieve the objectives of the game, not interacting with other players. Single player games
    * Multiplayer- all players in the game exist in the same world but don't interact with each other at all 
    * Cooperative play- everyone working together towards some objective
    * Player vs Player- somebody wins somebody loses
    * Multilateral competition- Everyone is against everyone else to defeat all others
    * Unilateral competition- one person versus everyone else
    * Team competition- players divide into multiple teams and attempt to beat other teams
* Rules- description of what actions the player may take
    * Defines actions taken and response at the given 
* Boundaries- distinction between game ends and real world begins
    * Boundary between real world and fake world 
    * Ex- poker can directly affect your wallet
* Resources- things of value that players collect
    * Extra lives, coins, etc
* Spaces- virtual world that is played in
    * Could have an overworld to get between levels, levels themselves are then different worlds too 
    * "Is this easy to navigate?"
* Tables- keeping track of the math that happens behind game events
    * Figure out the math behind random events, hits/misses
    * Gaining/losing resources
* Senses
    * Vision- the graphics
    * Hearing- sound effects, music
    * Touch- some games effect touch, how we use a controller, rumble effects
    * Smell or taste? Probs not gonna apply
* Goals of inscribed aesthetics
    * Set a different mood depending on the situation
    * Need to be able to differentiate between good and bad players
* Inscribed Narrative- background in which the story occurs
    * Start with a premise- should be brief 2 or 3 sentences
    * Setting- much more detail
        * Where
        * When
        * What is the culture? The technology?
    * Characters- do they have goals, personalities
    * Plot- things taking place during the game
        * Exposition>Rising action> Climax> falling action> denoument (wraps up story)
        * In a play, each of these things would be equal length but recently the ends of a game are much shorter. The climax of the story may even be in the last 20 minutes
        * Another take is the three-act structure
            * Act 1: hook>incident>1st plot point
            * Act 2: most of the story, do a lot, do everything>2nd plot point, longest part of story
            * Act 3: resolution
        * Linear narrative: no choice in story but they achieve what you want them to achieve eventually
        * Limited choices- The player must explicitly choose between several specific options
        * Factions and morals- players actions subtly add to or subtract form counters, may not be clear that you're effecting the narrative
            * These things all add up to the narrative 
        * Side quests- basically have linear narrative but also have other things to optionally do, and don't effect overall story
    * Player/character
        * Roleplaying- we're clearly different from the person we're playing as but we pretend to be them
        * Silent protagonist- player decides for themselves how the in-game persona will be with personality
        * Malleable protagonist- decide how player will respond. Pick kind of mean thing etc
    * Inscribed narrative- purpose
        * Evoking emotion
        * Motivation and justification
        * We aren't just wandering around for no reason, we need purpose to move and act in this world 
        * Positive plot encouraging achievement
    * Technology
#### Designing rules of the game
* Design process:
    1. Make up rules
    2. Quickly build a prototype
    3. Extensively playtest your prototype
    4. Analyze the results of playtesting
    5. Make small incremental changes
    6. Return to step 3, keep iterating
    * Is the difficulty fair?
    * Do players behind have a chance to catch up?
    * Is it fun?
    * Is it fun when its not your turn?
