## Dynamic and Cultural layers

* This is the layer that appears when people play the game

### Dynamic Mechanics
* Procedures: actions a player takes, both expressly ordered by the rules and that they develop on their own
    * All actions are **discernable** (game knows action was taken), **integrated** (all actions were meaningful in how they affect the game)
    * Players make plans for how they will achieve their goals
    * When designing game, think about the various strategies and make sure that there are multiple reasonable strategies
* **Achiever**- Seeks to optimize use of rules to dominate the game
* **Explorer**- Tries to find all secrets, understand all mechanics, try to deeply understand the game
* **Socializers**- wants to get to know other players, talk to them etc
* **Killer**- seeks to antagonize and dominate other players
* **Cheater**- Trying to win the game without caring about mastering rules, any means necessary
* **Spoilsport**- (Trolls/griefers) don't wanna win, make life more difficult for others
* Need to make game interesting for everyone except for probably cheaters and spoilsports
* How do we keep the game from being spoiled from others?
* Outcomes
    * Every action should change the state of the game in a meaningful way
    * Want people to think longer term- quest outcomes
    * Quests should give an award and offer a narrative component
    * Cumulative outcomes- over time player is working towards goal 
        * Example is an experience system- gradually working towards goal
    * Final outcome- game ends either in failure or some kind of success
* Aesthetics
    * Procedural music- write a bunch of songs that fit together, and as game is 
    going have algorithm to decide which song to play based on scenario
        * Don't just have one song per level necessarily
        * Speed of music can also change, ex if mario level time gets to 100 the song speeds up
        * Re-orchestration- Instead of a bunch of different songs, can also have one song that changes how it sounds depending on scenario
        * Procedural composition- game uses rules and randomness to generate new songs as it is being played
    * Procedural Visuals
        * Particle system- clouds, explosions etc
        * Animation- Objects can move in ways controlled by rules and randomness
        * Environments- Levels can be built by rules and randomness
            * can add infinite replayability
            * Hard to do well 
    * Environment and Players
        * Amount of light, display resolution has big effect on interpretation of visuals
        * Need game to look acceptable on many displays
        * Auditory- may be noisy, player may even mute the game
        * Many people are color blind, most have trouble with red or green
        * Be weary of flashing lights because of seizures
* Cultural layer
    * Fan creations- many people mod the games 
    * Mods can make the game way better by fixing bugs and adding lots of content
    * Need to design code to be modular if this is desired
    * Fans also add artwork/fan-fiction
    * Tools- help players play or understand game better, not a mod, external
        * Ex: Guides, calculators
    * Streaming- real time video of people playing the game
    * Impact of the game:
        * Addicting
        * Predatory monetization
        * Depictions of violence
        * Unrealistic representations of reality
## Implementation
### Text
* Screen is filled with characters from monospaced font
* Managed by character memory, display matrix, attribute memory
* Character Memory
    * Stores 9x16 (or other size) bitmap for each possible character
    * The bit map is for displaying letters by only having certain pixels active
* Display matrix
    * Stores the index of which character appears at each location
* Attribute memory
    * Stores things like color, bold, flashing etc
* Drawing the screen
    * Divide current pixel number by font size (height and width)
    * Integer division
    * Quotient of division gives index
    * Value in display matrix is an index into character memory
* Cooked vs Raw Mode
    * Cooked- OS handles cursor
        * anything printed is at cursor
        * Lines scroll off top of screen
        * All text typed is echoed to screen
        * Input is buffered and only sent to program when press enter
        * Input is buffered, only sent to program when hit enter
        * This is what 161 projects are 
        * Used for basic OS utilities, text games etc
    * Raw 
        * OS is out of way, we have full control over character memory, display matrix, etc
        * We can change previous text, change its attributes, etc
        * To do these things, need to send special escape sequences to display driver
        * No automatic input processing, no buffer either, key presses are immediately sent to program
        * Text user interface- emacs or vim use this, text takes whole screen and we move cursor to make changes
        * Curses library handles driver interface for us, abstraction
    * Most games use other modes though
    * Video mode
        * Frame buffer- giant matrix with number stored for every pixel for the color
        * Programmer can change any location
        * Page flipping- video memory is split in half, stores 2 frame buffers
            * Back buffer- directly interact with to change pixels
                * When ready in back buffer, flip back to front
            * Front buffer- what the user sees
            * Frame rate is how fast we can make back buffer, flip is instant
        * Graphical Libraries simplify things- OpenGL and DirectX 
        * This is the main approach to making games
        * Background typically does not change much though, silly to recreate it at every move
        * What if we separate background from things that move around?
        * Write background to frame buffer, and moving objects are called **sprites** which completely bypass frame buffer and have their own memory
        * **Sprites**
            * Small objects
            * Each is a partially transparent small image with location
            * Update location when move
            * Sprites are automatically drawn on top of framebuffer
            * "Should pixel be from background or sprite?"- Frame drawer
        * Static backgrounds can be boring, how do we deal with dynamic backgrounds without redrawing each pixel? 
        * **Tilesets**
            * framebuffer divided and filled with 8x8 images
            * Fill buffer with each unique image that could appear in background
            * Basically have a background made of sprites
            * To change background simply replace 8x8 region with different tile from tileset
            * Tilesets were popular in 8 bit and 16 it consoles, think zelda where tiles are things like rocks and tree tiles
## 3D Graphics
* Point is a location in 3D space, x,y,z
* Center of a room will be 0,0,0
* <-x-> left/right, y is up and down, z is front to back
* Mesh- collection of points that outline an object
    * To describe an object it would be perfect to have infinite number of points
    * Ideally- less points are used to just represent the shape of object
* Camera- viewpoint into the scene, where are we looking from?
    * Point where the camera is and how wide viewing angle is
* Light sources- Reflects light off surfaces towards camera so we can see things
* Materials/Textures- Description of what mesh should look like when lit up
    * Texture is an image
    * Material is just color, but also has a shinyness that is specified by properties to represent how the light reacts with it
* Transform- mathematical way of specifying that a point or mesh can be moved around (translating) or stretched (scaled), object changes in some way
    * Transform specifies exactly how object is in world 
* Graphics engine- lets us specify meshes, lights, cameras, materials, textures, transforms: This then does the computation for us of what the screen buffer has
* Game Engine- Graphics and collision detection
    * Many games need to simulate gravity
    * Music
    * Instead of rewriting the wheel of every game, use an engine that already has these specified
    * Early games were developed from scratch since the hardware was specific 
    * Every studio built their own game engines
    * First game engine that was mass distributed instead of kept in house was the Doom engine- id Tech 1
