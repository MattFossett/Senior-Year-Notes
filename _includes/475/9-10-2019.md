## Analysis State
### Who is my target audience? 
* What is my target platrofm?
* What genre am I working in? 
* What will motivate and engage my players?
* Can't just design games for myself, need to think of others

### What are my resources?
* How many hours can I afford to spend on it?
* Do I have collaborators?
* Be realistic- AAA games are built by teams of several hundred people over 2 years

### What prior art is there? 
* What other games try to do the same things that I do? 
    * Take inspiration!
* How do those games approach the problems I will face? 
* What do they do good/bad? 
* How will I make my game unique

* How do I get testable quickly? 

## Design Stage
* What elements will I incorporate?
    * Objectives, player relations, rules, boundaries, resources, spaces, tables, graphics, music, premise, setting, character, plot
* First pass
    * Focus on objectives, rules, and narrative premise
    * Fill in more details on each iteration
* Prototyping
    * Build whatever necessary to test design, fast as possible!
    * Consider paper prototypes if they will work, super fast to implement
    * Prioritize correct mechanics over correct aesthetics at this time
    * Use free assets as placeholders and replace with better themed things later

## Testing Stage
### Involve other people
* Fresh eyes don't have built in assumptions
* Be clear that you want honest feedback
* Ask specific questions- 
    * Don't ask "was it fun" 
    * Ask "Was it too difficult?" "what did you think of the controls?"
    * Think of the bartok example
* Thorough testing

### Using testing data
    * Next analysis stage seeks to understand testing results
    * Fix negative results without disturbing positives
    * Don't add more things until negatives are fixed

## Innovation
* Incremental Innovation
    * Take existing idea and make it better
    * Easy to think of and convince stakeholders
    * Easy to think of ways to improve other ideas
    * "We're gonna do what they did but **better**
    * Games that are just incremental improvements might sell well but likely won't be super memorable
### Intersectional Innovation
* Take two or more unrelated ideas and combine them in a way that has never been done before
* High risk but high reward
* Tough to think of games that would mesh well
* EX: 
    * Dungeons and Dragons was the intersection of war gaming with drama
    * Magic: The gathering- Intersection of fast-paced card games and baseball card collection
    * Half Life- FPS games and story-telling of adventure games
    * Deus Ex- FPS games and RPG

### Lightning innovation
* Create brand new idea never seen before
* Super hard to do 
* Hard to sell to others because it can't be compared to other games

## Brainstorming
* Don't know where to start with a new game? Start thinking
* Have lots of ideas (many bad) and hope that one will be pretty good

1. Expansion
    * Start with theme, write it on the board in a circle
    * ... missing info
2. Collision
    * Write all ideas from boards on index cards
    * Shuffle cards and deal pairs to each member (Multiple pairs if necessary)
    * Try to find 3 ideas that could make the collision work
3. Rating and discussion
    * Everyone secretly votes choosing the 3 most promising ideas
    * Tally votes
    * Talk about ideas with most votes
        * How could it be improves? What other details are required?

* Idea=>Prototype=>Alter prototype=>Game

* In the beginning you constantly change the idea, change everything
* After project progresses start committing to things good or bad
* Vaporware- Promise game but never release

## Typical stages
* Pre-production- Experimenting with ideas, building prototypes, small teams, ends with short demo that nails the idea of the game
* Production- Lock down design decisions, most implementation happens, ends with complete playable game (if you restart then you're talking vaporware)
    * This has full large teams working
* Alpha testing- Playtesting with tons of people, change things like level design, add new weapons but don't change full mechanics
* Beta- change nothing- only fix bugs
* Gold Product is shipped to customers- no changes at this point
* Post-release (Modern)- periodic bug fixes and balance changes

## Scoping
* Be careful about scope
* Overscoping- thinking you can do too much 
    * Major killer of small projects
* Best game is one that is finished in the hands of players

## Lights and Cameras

### Coloring a Pixel
#### Fragment processing
* Rays shoot out from camera in different directions for each pixel, see what they hit
* Now we need to know what the object looks like
#### Object Appearance
* Texture/ material determines what color reflects from that location
#### Global Illumination
* Every light source is sending out rays to see what objects they hit
* If those objects are reflective they also send out rays to see what they hit
* Repeat several times

### Light source type: Ambient
* Everything has some uniform light shining on it 
* Does not produce shadows or specular reflections, no shine
* Everything is visible even if technically no light reflected
* Include ambient light so that at least everything is visible (On by default in unity)

### Light source type: Directional
* Light comes from a direction, comes in parallel rays from an infinite plane hitting everything in its path
* Like the sun
* Use it to simulate the sun or other far away sources of light
* Shiny spots on reflective objects are called specular reflections

### Light source type: Point
* Light illuminates from a single point every direction
* There is a maximum distance, things farther are lit of less
* Things like lightbulbs, torches
* Game objects with light component (Game object menu->light)
* Lighting can be added to any game object, from rendering menu

### Light source type: Spot
* Point that sends out rays within a cone, brighter towards center of cone 

### Cameras
* Orthographic projection- shows everything at exact size, parallels look parallel
    * Far away things don't get smaller
    * Everything looks weird and flat 
    * Good for 2d games, minimaps, not 3d games
* Field of View
    * How wide we can see 
* Clipping Planes
    * Near and far clipping planes
    * Don't see things on wrong side of camera
    * Need near plane so that we get saved from ugly graphics in front of camera
    * We only see the things in between the near and far clipping planes
* Viewport Rect
    * X,Y,W,H
    *
