## Testing
* Not testing for bugs, more for deciding if game works, is it fun, is narrative good etc
* 3 people to test:
    * Designers/ devs 
    * Investigators- administor the test
    * Play testers- actually playing 
    * Don't want any overlap between these roles
* How to be good playtester
    * Think out loud- why are you doing things? There are listeners that would be able to use your thoughts to help with feedback
    * Reveal your biases- If you're familiar with the genre then you will approach it a certain way, you'll have different expectations. Inspector needs to know that you may be familiar with the controls already
    * Self analyze- explain why you dislike or like something
    * Separate elements- Think about aesthetics, narrative, mechanics etc Individually
    * Be humble, they may not even take your advice
* Design/development team
    * Designers are the first to test the game
    * Then trusted friends will likely be asked
* Try not to reuse playtesters
* Don't argue with the playtester, they're always right 
* Take good notes about what they are doing while playing your game

Playtester notes:

* Likes help interface
* Wishes there was something like inferring input args or tab completion
* Picked up the flow of the game quickly
* Objective unclear
* Desks and tables are unclear

Formal Group Testing
* Select group of playtesters, give them game with few instructions
* Observe for 30 minutes or so
* Have specific objectives for the test
* Administer written survey after gameplay
* Present survey after with open ended questions, 3 favorite parts of the game, describe the feelings you felt, how was the protagonist etc

Online testing
* Very valuable
* First have closed beta, invite specific people you think will provide good feedback
* Then limited beta- accept first N number of people to show up
* Open beta- anyone can participate, play the unfinished game, be fully prepared for answer to be no one. May need to market game better. 
* Consider automated beta logging since you may not get direct feedback from players
    * Allows you to see which things are getting chosen, nerf overpowered items etc
    * Do this with really any software, see how people are using your software
* Q&A- Generally done in-house, if a playtester finds a bug its a bonus but bug finding should be a dedicated search from people on the team

Particle Systems
* Emits small objects that are short-lived
* Used for dust, fires, explosions, clouds, snow
* Emitter is controlled by the Shape module

Renderer Module
* Controls actual particles
* Render mode controls how the particles are drawn and material controls what they look like
* Save processing power by using 2d "Billboard" particles
* Stretched billboard allows the sprites to always face the camera
*
