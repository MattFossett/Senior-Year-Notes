## Paper Prototyping
* Build prototypes with physical objects, mostly paper 
* Iterate design, implement, test with them before moving to digital 

## Prefabs
* Take existing object from scene and drag into project, now have a copy-able object
* Can make changes to original prefab and then those changes will apply to all of them

## Canvas
* Can hold other UI elements (make them its children in hierarchy)
* Is transparent
* By defauly, isoverlayed on top on entire screen
* Always comes with an EventSystem

## Image
* One of many things that can be placed on a canvas
* Make it a child element of a canvas

## Anchors
* Every UI element has an anchor that describes where it is on the campus
* UI Element is positioned relative to its anchor
* Anchor positions: (0,0) is bottom left of canvas, (1,1) is top right
* Element uses Rect transform: distance of object from anchor

### Anchor modes
* Anchor together: element maintains distance from anchor when canvas is resized / shaped
* Anchor split (min and max different): Element maintains ratio of distance to anchor and canvas size
